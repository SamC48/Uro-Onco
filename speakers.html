				<span><p class="lead">
					Dr Prinitha Pillay's sojourn into medicine did not begin in the field of oncology; instead, Dr Pillay spent the first 25 years of her medical career navigating diverse and often challenging environments that ultimately shaped her path toward oncology. Her motivation stemmed from a growing awareness: cancer is on the rise, often remains invisible until it is too late, and disproportionately affects the most vulnerable. Driven by a deep sense of purpose and the desire to effect meaningful change, she has committed herself to improving early detection and access to integrative, comprehensive cancer care—hallmarks of quality healthcare delivery.
				</p></span>
				<span><p class="lead">
					After earning a BSc (Hons) in Molecular Biology from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1996, Dr Pillay pursued a career in medicine, qualifying as a medical doctor in 2003. Her early medical journey took her into humanitarian settings with Doctors Without Borders, where she worked over a decade in countries such as Lesotho, South and North Sudan, India, Sierra Leone, Libya, and throughout urban and rural South Africa. These experiences not only sharpened her clinical acumen under pressure but also cemented her advocacy for patient-centred care and health equity. She went on to serve as President of Doctors Without Borders in South Africa and contributed to the organisation’s global governance. In recognition of her leadership and impact, she was named one of the Top 10 Women in Health by the Mail &amp; Guardian in 2011.
				</p></span>
				<span><p class="lead">
					Upon returning to South Africa in 2012, Dr Pillay joined the University of the Witwatersrand as a technical specialist in HIV and TB, while also lending her voice to the Rural Health Advocacy Project to champion improved healthcare access in underserved areas. She was appointed an independent external panelist for the South African Human Rights Commission’s investigation into access to emergency medical services as a fundamental human right. During this period, she completed a Master’s degree in Infectious Diseases and Global Policy from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
				</p></span>
				<span><p class="lead">
					Dr Pillay's career has consistently bridged bedside care with health systems advocacy. Her work, particularly with Doctors Without Borders, underscored the importance of bearing witness to suffering and speaking out on behalf of those without a voice. This commitment led her to specialise in Radiation Oncology, completing her Fellowship and a Master of Medicine degree focused on the sexual health and side effects experienced by women with cervical cancer following chemoradiation.
